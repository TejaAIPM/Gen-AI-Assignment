GPS Log Book – User Manual www.gpslogbook.co.za Page 5 of 21  The LED will be solid red – this indicates that the device has not yet found its position and is searching for satellites .  The LED will turn green – this indicates that the device has found its location and tracking is in progress .  The vehicle can now be driven and the GPS Log Book device will record the trip .  Remove the device at any stage to stop the recording . NOTE: The device will end a trip when it loses power. Some vehicles’ 12V outlet / cigarette lighter do not switch off when the ignition is turned off. In these cases the device will stop recording data and go into a low power mode when the vehicle does not move for 5 minutes. 5.2 LED Information Red The log book has powe r and is searching for satellites Green The log book has found satellites and is logging Flashing Red The log book is 80% full and will need to be connected to the server soon to upload the data (see below). NOTE:  If the solid Red does not turn Green then the device is unable to find any satellites (e.g. if the vehicle is parked in a basement) and no data will be recorded.  It is recommend ed that the device is synchronised at least every 11 to 14 days. This will ensure optimal GPS performance is maintained.  The log book will find satellites faster if it has valid aiding data. Roughly speaking, aiding data gives the GPS an idea of where to start looking for satellites and hence helps it to find its location faster. This data will be loaded onto the device almost every time it is connected to the computer , and is valid for 14 days . 6 Getting Started 6.1 Download the GPS Log Book Sync Application The Sync Application is the application used to read data off the device and send it to the GPS Log Book server for processing and storing. Download and install this application before connecting the GPS Log Book device to your computer/laptop for the first time 1.
